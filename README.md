# Restaurant-Staff-Status-Management-System
This was our Final Project of our Computer Programming Course way back in our Freshmen Year. This Java program tracks the status of each employee/staff in a restaurant. The user(Manager) will be prompted to assign a names for each employee and the program will display the results right after the process.
